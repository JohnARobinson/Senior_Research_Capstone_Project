1. Abstract:
This particular research is an exploration of artificial intelligence and deep neural networks in relation to image recognition. The foundation and basis for starting this research is the wide number of applications as well as the potential of this field. Before diving into understanding the facial/image recognition element there must be understanding of the building blocks that support it. 

2. Neural Networks:
The baseline to take into account is Artificial Neural Networks. “ANNs are processing devices (algorithms or actual hardware) that are loosely modeled after the neuronal structure of the mammalian cerebral cortex but on much smaller scales”(shipyard). Neural networks are usually organized into layers which are made up of interconnected nodes which contain an activation function. Patterns are presented by an input layer which communicates to hidden layers which process the input. This is connected to an output layer. ANN’s are trained by feeding large quantities of data. Training at a basic level is providing input to ANN and then telling it what the input should be. 

To break it down a neural network is a number of artificial neurons called units separated by a series of layers. The units are separated into different specific types. The first being input units, input units are for receiving some sort of informatio n that the neural network will process. There are also output units which are what the neural network does with the information it processes. What's in between these two layers are the previously mentioned layers which are also units, called but they are hidden units. Another concept to consider is that most neural networks are fully connected which means every hidden unit and output unit is connected to every unit on either side of it.(Woodford, 2020)(Kailash, 2017)
